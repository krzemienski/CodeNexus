# File Structure Document for CodeNexus.ai

## Introduction
In any software development project, a well-organized file structure is crucial as it lays the foundation for clear, scalable, and maintainable code. It enhances collaboration by ensuring that team members have a common understanding of where files are located and how they interact with one another. CodeNexus.ai, a mobile app aimed at augmenting developers' coding experiences through AI-assisted insights, requires such an organized structure to manage its diverse functionalities effectively. This document will guide you through the file organization tailored to our selected tech stack, ensuring the project operates smoothly and remains scalable.

## Overview of the Tech Stack
CodeNexus.ai leverages a modern tech stack to deliver its innovative features. The frontend is developed using React Native with TypeScript, providing a flexible platform for building cross-platform mobile apps. Expo is used to simplify the development and testing process. The backend infrastructure utilizes Supabase or a Node/Python server, potentially integrating with Vapor for data management and user authentication. AI capabilities span local AI processing using Core ML or TensorFlow Lite and extend to third-party integrations with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This diverse stack influences our file structure by necessitating clear separation between frontend and backend services and the integration of local and cloud-based AI modules.

## Root Directory Structure
The root directory serves as the foundation of the CodeNexus.ai project, encapsulating the main directories and essential configuration files. Key directories include:

- **/src**: Contains all the source code, split between frontend and backend subdirectories.
- **/docs**: Holds documentation related to project setup, guidelines, and any developer or user manuals.
- **/config**: Includes configuration files for build processes, environment settings, and API integrations.
- **/tests**: Houses testing files, ensuring that both unit and integration tests are easily accessible.
- **/assets**: Used for storing images, fonts, and other static resources essential to the app.

Important files residing at the root level might include `package.json` for dependency management, `.gitignore` to specify untracked files, and `README.md` for project overview and setup instructions.

## Frontend File Structure
The frontend structure of CodeNexus.ai is designed to support modularity and reusability, crucial for a scalable mobile app. Within the `/src/frontend` directory, subdirectories include:

- **/components**: Reusable UI components are stored here, organized by feature (e.g., Login, Dashboard).
- **/screens**: Contains distinct screen-level components, each reflecting a primary app feature or page (e.g., HomeScreen, CodeViewerScreen).
- **/styles**: Global and component-specific style sheets reside here, promoting consistent UI styling.
- **/utils**: Utility functions and helpers that support frontend tasks, such as formatting or state management.

The structure ensures that large codebases remain navigable and components are easily reusable across different parts of the app.

## Backend File Structure
The backend organization is located in the `/src/backend` directory, designed for maintainability and scalability. It is compartmentalized as follows:

- **/routes**: Defines the API endpoint structure, directing incoming requests to appropriate controllers.
- **/controllers**: Houses the logic for handling API requests, receiving user input, and returning responses.
- **/models**: Contains database schema definitions and interactions for consistently managing data.
- **/services**: Includes business logic and external service integrations (e.g., GitHub, AI models).

This organization ensures that the backend can efficiently handle the app's varied data and service transactions, supporting both user interactions and AI processing.

## Configuration and Environment Files
In the `/config` directory, configuration files hold critical settings that govern the behavior of both the development and production environments.

- **.env**: Stores environment variables like API keys and secrets, crucial for managing access to services securely.
- **babel.config.js** or **metro.config.js**: Contains configurations for JavaScript compilation and bundling processes.
- **expo.config.js**: Relevant for settings specific to Expo, ensuring project compatibility with different platforms.

These files allow for easy adaptation to different development needs and environments, facilitating smooth transitions from local development to production deployment.

## Testing and Documentation Structure
Testing and documentation are vital for quality assurance and knowledge sharing, residing in their respective directories.

- The `/tests` directory includes test files organized by feature or component, employing testing frameworks compatible with our tech stack.

- The `/docs` directory is dedicated to documentation such as API references, coding guidelines, and system architecture overviews.

This structural organization ensures that any developer can quickly locate testing suites and reference materials, promoting a culture of rigorous quality and collaborative documentation.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary
The file structure of CodeNexus.ai is a meticulously organized framework designed to support the development and maintenance of a sophisticated, AI-guided mobile app. By separating concerns between the frontend and backend, and establishing clear directories for configurations, tests, and documentation, we ensure a high level of project clarity and collaboration. This structure not only facilitates current development needs but positions the app for future scalability and feature expansion. The integration of modern development practices and tools with a clear hierarchical file system distinguishes this project, setting it apart as both an efficient and robust software solution.
