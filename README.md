## **Overview**

CodeNexus.ai is built to empower developers to:
- **Explore** topics and repositories of interest.
- **Learn** from AI-curated repository insights.
- **Create** a personalized nexus of repositories for long-term mastery.

The app offers three tiers of AI integration:
1. **Local AI**: On-device processing for quick and offline tasks.
2. **Custom LLM**: Your custom-trained open-source LLM for intermediate analysis.
3. **Third-Party AI**: Advanced, resource-intensive tasks handled by APIs like OpenAI.

---

## **Features**

- **Topic Exploration**: Browse GitHub topics and discover repositories based on your interests.
- **Repository Insights**: Gain AI-driven insights, including summaries, tutorials, and suggested learning paths.
- **Code Viewing**: Read and analyze code directly in the app with syntax highlighting and inline AI assistance.
- **Nexus Creation**: Curate your personalized collection of repositories for further study.
- **Settings and Customization**: Adjust preferences, including themes, AI usage, and account settings.

- **Frontend**: The iOS and Web applications provide the user interface and interact with the backend.
- **Backend**: Manages API calls, authentication, and routing requests to AI services.
- **AI Tiers**: 
  - Local AI for lightweight tasks.
  - Custom LLM for mid-tier processing.
  - Third-Party AI for heavy computational tasks.
- **External Services**: GitHub API for accessing repositories and topics.

### **AI Tier Integration**

- **Local AI**: Processes syntax highlighting and small-scale analyses offline.
- **Custom LLM**: Trained on open-source data for contextual repository insights.
- **Third-Party AI**: Executes complex tasks like generating tutorials or learning paths.
